1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay now let's go ahead and add one more notification; we're going to do this in a very similar way as we

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
did the last one. What we're going to do is we're going to create a notification when the total is equal to

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or exceeds the goal. So when the user has reached their goal, we want to show them a notification.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So all we're going to do this time is we're going to go into our popup.js and then inside here where we're

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
adding the amount, we want to check to see if the new total is going to be greater than the goal.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, we're going to need to get the goal, so we're going to go ahead and change this so we're getting the

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
total and the goal. And then we're just going to simply do a check here, so we're just going to say,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
if(newTotal &gt;= items.goal), then let's go ahead and show a notification that says that they've met their goal.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So let's go ahead and copy this and change this.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we still want the type to be basic; we're going to say here "Goal reached!" and then for our message,

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:24,000
let's go ahead and make this be "You reached your goal of" and then let's put here items.goal and then an

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
exclamation mark. So then we're going to still use this icon.png; again, you could use different icons for

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
different notifications if you wanted to. And then we want to actually do the notifying, so we're going to

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
call chrome.notifications.create and then we'll give this an id. For this one, let's call it goalReached

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and then we pass in our options and then a blank function, because we're not going to do anything when this completes.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So now we can go ahead and save that and let's go ahead and

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
open up our browser and now let's see what we have â€” we have a goal of 150.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, if we put in an amount of, let's say 100, we get a total of 100, but now if I put in 60, you can see

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:59:00,000
"Goal reached! You reached your goal of 150."
