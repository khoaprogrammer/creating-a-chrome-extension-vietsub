00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so in our browser now, if we click our extension, we've got our Protein Tracker UI coming up,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and if we right-click here, we should be seeing Options. Now we're not going to see Options just yet,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
because we haven't reloaded this plug-in. Again, we've changed the manifest file so we do need to reload this,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so let's go ahead and go to reload here and now if we right-click here we see Options and when we click that

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
you'll notice it opens up a new tab that has our Options. So now we can type in a Goal, let's say we put in 100,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and if we click Save, it closes that. Now we don't have this Goal showing up here; we'll need to implement

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that functionality, but our Options page should work. So if we right-click, go to Options, you can see the

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Goal is populated at 100 there. We should also be able to reset the Total, so right now our Total is 38.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's go ahead and click this Reset Total, and now you can see that the Total is 0.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we have most of that functionality working; at this point the only thing we really need to add is the

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ability to show this goal here, so that shows up in this UI. So let's go ahead and do that real quick.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What we want to do for this is we're just going to go back into our popup.html and what we want to do is

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
we want to populate this here. So we're going to need to put in a value and let's just call this id goal

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and then we want to go into our popup.js, and here, the way that we're going to do this is we're going to

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
get back both the total and the goal at the same time here when we first load up this page.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, instead of just passing in a string, we can pass in an array of strings, and we do that in JavaScript notation,

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
like this with the brackets, so we're going to ask for goal and total.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we should get back both of those things and then all we're going to do here is we're just going to say,

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
okay, give us the goal, set the text equal to items.goal, and that should pretty much do it.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's go ahead and open up our browser window.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And we should just be able to go here now and we can see our Goal.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So now if we go to Options, let's change this to, say 150 and save it, and then we'll re-open up our extension,

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and you can see that the goal is set to 150. We can still add protein, that works, and we should see our goal in our Options.
