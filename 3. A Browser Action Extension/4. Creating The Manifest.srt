1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create our directory that we're going to create

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
our extension in, so I'm just going to create this directory called ProteinTracker, and inside here we're

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to create our manifest file. So I'm just going to add a new text document and I'm just going to call this

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
manifest.json and we're going to create this file just like we did for our first Hello World extension;

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm just going to go ahead and open this up in Visual Studio.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And like I said, you can use whatever editor that you want and what we're going to do is we're just going

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to go ahead and set all the properties for this manifest file. So remember, there are a few things that

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we need to have - we need to have the manifest_version and this is going to be version 2 because that's

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the current version of the manifest, the latest version, and then we want to give this a name, which we'll

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
have to specify, so we're going to call this Protein Tracker, and then let's go ahead and add a description.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This one is optional, but we want to have a description, so let's say "Tracks a user's protein totals

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
throughout the day." Then we're going to want the version for our actual extension, which we're just going

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to make this 1.0 to start with, and now we're going to want to add our browser action, because remember

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
this is of type browser_action. In the next module we'll be creating a page_action one, but in this one

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we are using a browser_action, which means that it's going to show up in that toolbar always.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And with this browser_action, we're creating a new object inside here, a nested object, so you can think of

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
these as sort of subproperties. So we have our default_icon and we're just going to call this icon.png,

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
just like we did before, and then for our default_popup, we're going to do the same thing as well and we're

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
just going to call this popup.html. And that's all we're going to do for our manifest at this point.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We'll be adding some things later to this manifest when we need to add some permissions and an options page

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and our background page, but for now that's all we'll need.
