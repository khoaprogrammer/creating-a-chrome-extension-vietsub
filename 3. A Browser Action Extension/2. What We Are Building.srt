1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're going to be building the famous Protein Tracker Application that's able to track a user's protein total

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
versus the goal they set. We'll be basically building a simple application in the form of a chrome extension.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The idea of this extension is that a user should be able to click the extension to see the protein total

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and goal, and then be able to add protein to their running total from that user interface.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The user should also be able to get to an options screen where they can reset the total and set a goal.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the extension should provide notifications to the user when they reset the total or achieve their goal.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We'll even add the ability for a user to add protein to their total by selecting a number on a loaded page

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and selecting â€˜Add Protein' from the right-click context menu.
