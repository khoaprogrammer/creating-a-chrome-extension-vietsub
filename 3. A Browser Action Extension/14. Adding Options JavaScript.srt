1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, so let's go ahead and clear out some of this that we have in our options.js so we can implement the logic

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we want here. Now, the first thing that we're going to want to do is we're going to want to populate that

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
goal input if we have a goal, so we're actually going to change this; instead of doing chrome.storage.sync.get total,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
let's go ahead and say get the goal. And then here we have a goal input and we're going to change the text,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and in this case since it's an input, it'll be the val, so we'll change the value equal to items.goal.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now if there isn't already a goal saved, then that's fine - it's not actually going to do anything.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to hook up the Save button.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So we want to go ahead and say when you click the save button and execute this JavaScript function, and inside here,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
what we want to do is we want to go ahead and save that goal using the chrome storage.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So let's create a variable goal and we're going to set this equal to whatever the goal text is, so we use

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
this val to get that, and then if(goal), so if there's actually something entered there, then we can go ahead

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and do chrome.storage.sync.set, and then remember here we pass in an object, so we just specify whatever

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
properties we want for this, we want it to have a property called goal, that'll be our key, and then it'll

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
be equal to whatever the goal is, and then we're actually going to create a callback here.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So when this finishes, when it's done saving, then we're going to go ahead and close the browser window,

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
or rather, we're going to close the tab; so we're going to do close here, so that should close that tab.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then, there's one more thing we want to implement, we want to implement this reset functionality.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So let's go ahead and do that as well, so we're going to say (â€˜#reset').click and then here we're going to pass in

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
a function, and inside reset what we're going to want to do is for now all we're going to do is we're just

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
going to reset the total, so we're basically going to do chrome.storage.sync.set, and then we're going to

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
set the total property equal to 0. Now later on we'll actually make this show notification, but for now

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we're just going to set the total to 0. So let's go ahead and test this out next.
