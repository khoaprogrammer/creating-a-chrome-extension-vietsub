00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so now to do the next step, which is we're going to basically add a badge that's going to show what

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the current protein count is; we're actually going to make use of an Event Page.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So the way that we do this is we have to go to our manifest, and inside here, we can specify the background,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and this is called background because there used to only be background pages and now background pages and

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
event pages are specified here. So, what we're going to do is we're going to create a background property,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and inside here, we're going to create an object that has our options.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we put our scripts in here and this is going to be an array of the scripts that are going to be loaded;

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we're just going to make our script called eventPage.js. And then we need to specify whether this is persistent,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so we're going to say persistent equals false. Now if you made persistent true, it would actually be a background page;

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
by making persistent false, it's an event page. So it's not going to live forever, it's only going to be

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
invoked when it's needed. Basically what we're going to do with our event page is we're going to register

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
some event handlers, we're going to listen for certain things, and that's what we're going to do in that

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
script, and then it will get invoked whenever those events fire.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you just use the background page, you would have it running all the time so you wouldn't necessarily

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
have to listen for a specific event; you could have that page going pretty much all the time in the background.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And there are some cases where you'd want to do that, but in most cases you want to try and use the event page

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
instead because it's going to take up less resources. So, now the next thing we need to do is to go ahead

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and create this eventPage.js. So let's go ahead and do a â€˜New Text Document' and we'll just call this eventPage.js.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And now let's go ahead and implement that functionality.
