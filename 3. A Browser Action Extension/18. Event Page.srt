00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Often when creating an extension, you'll need some JavaScript code to run when the extension first loads

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
before a user clicks the icon in the toolbar. In that case, a Background Page is needed.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As we talked about earlier, there are two types of background pages - persistent ones called Background Pages

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and Event Pages, which are only activated at certain times. In most cases, you can get away with just using

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
an Event Page and it's preferred because it takes up less resources.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll be using an Event Page in our extension to register for any changes to the protein total and

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
update the badge that shows the current total, like you can see here, any time it changes.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We'll also use the Event Page to register a new context menu item, like you can see here,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that will be displayed when a user has selected some text and right-clicks.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We'll add an event handler that will respond to that menu item being selected,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
which will attempt to add the selected text as a protein amount if the text is a number.
