00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, so now let's go ahead and open up a browser window and then we're going to need to reload this.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So let's go ahead and go to our Extensions.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And since we changed the permissions, we're just going to do a reload here, and then now we should be able

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to go ahead and use our context menu. Now if I right-click here, you're not going to see anything â€”

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you're not going to see it unless I am highlighting some text and then it will have a number to use.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's do something like search for calorie counter.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And maybe we can find some food nutrition data, this would be a good usage for this, so let's say burger,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we can go in here and we should be able to find something like protein, there we go, 22.3 grams.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's just highlight our 22 and then I can right-click here and click Add Protein and you can see the 22 appeared.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We've added 22 to our total. So this will work, I could grab, for example, this number 145, right-click,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and do Add Protein, and you can see that that total's updated here now as well.
