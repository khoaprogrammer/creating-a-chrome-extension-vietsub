1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so next we're going to add an Options page. In order to do that, what we're going to need to do is

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to go into our manifest.json and we're going to have to add the entry for what the Options page is.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Every single extension that we create can have an Options page; we just have to specify that as a property

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in our manifest. So let's go ahead and add this here and all we have to do is specify here options_page

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then the name of what that options page is going to be, so we're just going to call this options.html,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then we'll go ahead and create an options.html in our directory.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's go ahead and open our directory and we'll just do a new, in fact let's just go ahead and copy our

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
popup.html to give us a bit of a head start here and we'll call this options.html, and then let's go ahead

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and open this up in our Editor, and now we can go ahead and implement our options.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, for our Options page, we're just going to make a real simple UI that's going to show what the goal is

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
in an input textbox that the user can change that goal and then we're going to have a button for saving

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and one for resetting the total. So let's go ahead and change this title to Protein Tracker Options,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and then for our script, we're going to include jQuery, but let's also include this options.js, so we'll

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
have to create some JavaScript for our page and then we'll just call this Protein Tracker Options and then

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
here let's go ahead and leave our h2, and instead of having a span here, let's go ahead and put an input.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This way we'll have our input here that someone can enter the goal amount and we can save it from getting it

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
from this input. We'll want to change this id as well, so let's make this id be goal and then let's go ahead

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and add our buttons, so we're going to have one button for saving, so we'll give this the id of save and

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we'll give a value here of Save, and then let's add another button right below this, which we'll call our

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
reset button and the value for this one will be Reset Total.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So now let's just go ahead and check out our UI here in our Explorer window.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So if we go ahead and open this up, we can see that this looks okay - not the prettiest user interface,

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but this should work for our Protein Tracker Options.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And then we're going to need that JavaScript file as well, so let's go ahead and we're just going to copy

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and paste this one and we'll call this one options.js.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then we need to implement this functionality for our options, which we'll do next.
