1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So at this point we're almost ready to go ahead and test out our extension to get it loaded into our browser,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but before we do that we do need an icon, so I've already created an icon here, a very nice looking icon

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that says PT for protein tracker and this icon, remember, this is 19x19 pixels — this is the icon that's

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
going to be displayed in that toolbar. So now we should be all set up to actually add this extension.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So I'm just going to go ahead and get a browser window here and then I'm just going to go to Settings and

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Extensions, that's another way to get to Extensions if you forget the URL up here, and then we're going to

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
go ahead and do a ‘Load unpacked extension' and we're just going to find where this extension is.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So it's under here, Creating Chrome Extension, and then I've got this ProteinTracker.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So now you can see that it immediately loaded up, we've got our nice little icon here, and then when we

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
click it, we see our user interface; it just says Protein Tracker, Total: 0, Goal: 0, Enter amount —

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
of course this doesn't work quite yet, but you should get to this step if you have everything set up correctly.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You have to have your icon, you have to have the HTML. If you reference anything that doesn't exist,

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you'll have a problem loading this, so that's why we haven't referenced anything else in our manifest or in our HTML yet.
