Hi, this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight, and in this module we'll be creating a Browser Action Extension.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the last module, we also created a browser action extension, but it was pretty simple and didn't really

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
use any of the chrome APIs. This time, though, we'll be expanding on what we learned from our first extension

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and be building a more robust extension that uses the chrome storage APIs for storing and syncing data.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The browser action badge has an options page and even uses an event page that runs in the background to register

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for events. By the end of this module, you should have a pretty good idea of how to create a more complex

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:59:00,000
browser action extension and be familiar with some of the capabilities of the chrome API.
