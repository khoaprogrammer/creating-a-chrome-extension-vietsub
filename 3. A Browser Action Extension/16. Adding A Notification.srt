1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So next up we want to add some notifications. Right now when we click Reset in our options, it's not very

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
clear to the user that their total was reset, and since this is a destructive action we should probably

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
notify them in some way. So what we're going to do is we're going to use notifications to do that.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So in order to be able to use notifications, we have to add a permission, so we're going to go to our permissions,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and in addition to storage, we're going to add notifications. So this will give us access to the

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Notification API inside of chrome and then what we're going to do, it's going to be pretty simple,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
all we're going to do is in our options.js when we do this reset, instead of just doing this and forgetting about it,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we're going to go ahead and do a callback, so we're going to pass in this function, and inside here what we

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
want to do is we want to call chrome.notifications.create to create a notification.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So we're just going to do this var opt to make an object that's going to contain the options for our notification.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We could do this inline as well, but there's a lot here so it's nice to create the object outside in

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
a separate variable. So we're going to save that, first of all the type, and this is going to be basic.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So there's a few different types of notifications, we're not going to get into the different types here,

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but you could check that out in the chrome APIs, and then we're going to set the title for the notification,

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
which is going to be "Total reset!" and then we're going to set the message.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So this is the message that will be displayed and we're going to say "Total has been reset back to 0."

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And then we can specify what the icon URL is, and in our case, we're just going to use the one icon that we have.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's going to look a little bit weird because it's going to blow it up, but you can create another icon if

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you want to, you can customize any of these things; in fact, you might want to have different icons for

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
different types of notifications that you would use in your app.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So then we're going to call chrome.notifications.create and here what we want to do is specify an id for

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that particular notification so we can uniquely identify it and then the options.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, we're just going to call this one reset for the id and then we're going to pass in our options and then

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we can pass in a callback, and I believe this one requires you to have a callback parameter, so we're just

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
going to pass in an empty function, we don't actually care to have a callback in our case.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, now we should see a little notification show up at the bottom of the screen when we click the reset.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now this is only going to work, I believe, on Windows and on Chrome OS right now.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't think notifications are implemented on the other operating systems and that may change by the time

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that you're listening to this course, so don't be surprised if notifications don't work if you're not using

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Windows or Chrome OS. Okay, so let's go ahead and go back to our browser and then remember we've changed

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the permissions here, so we're going to need to reload this. So let's go ahead and go into our extensions,

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and then we're going to go ahead and reload this extension, and then now, if we right-click here and go to Options

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and we click Reset Total, there you go, you can see this Total reset, Total has been Reset back to 0.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And you can see it's blown up this icon, so if you actually had an icon of a larger size, this would show up

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
a little bit better in here, but this is the basic way to create notifications, which this is a pretty useful

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
feature of Chrome to be able to access these notifications. You can actually make it so that when a user

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
clicks on that notification, it does something, maybe it takes you to an option page or something like that,

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and you can also update those notifications if you want through that API.
