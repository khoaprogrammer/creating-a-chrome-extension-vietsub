00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In order to be able to add protein to our total and display the current total, we're going to make use of

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the chrome storage APIs. We could, of course, just use the HTML5 local storage, but by using the chrome

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
storage APIs we can automatically gain the ability to sync data and we can store whole objects instead of strings.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We'll start off by causing a click on the Add Protein button to get the current total, if there is one,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
from the Chrome storage, and then add the entered amount to that total, then we'll save that total in the Chrome storage.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll also add functionality to get the total from the Chrome storage as soon as our page loads and display it

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in the UI next to the total. We'll be using jQuery to make this all easier, but it isn't required.
