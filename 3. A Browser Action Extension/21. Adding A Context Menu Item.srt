1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so the last thing that we're going to do is we're going to make a context menu item to be able to

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
add protein by highlighting some text and then basically selecting the Add Protein Option and we're going to

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
utilize the event page to do this as well. So there's a couple things that we're going to need to do.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First of all, we need to be able to use the menu or to add to the menu, so we have to go back into our manifest.json,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and inside here, what we want to do is add a permission for the menu.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we're going to do a permission here for contextMenus.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, we can go into our event page, and inside here, we're going to create a new menu item and then we're

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
going to register for an onClicked on the context menu. So let's go ahead and add this above here.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So we're going to create a variable called menuItem and we're going to set this equal to an object that

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
we'll create here that will have an id, which will be equal to addProtein.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is how we'll uniquely identify our menuItem that we're going to add.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then our menuItem will have a title, it will be called addProtein, and then it will have certain contexts

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that it'll operate in, and again, you can check the API documentation to find out what all the contexts are,

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but we want this to operate on selection. So this is going to basically appear on the context menu when

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
some text is selected on a page and only in that instance; it's not going to appear if you just right-click

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:49,000
without selecting anything. So now all we have to do is call chrome.contextMenus.create and we're going to

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
pass in our menuItem. This will make sure that our menuItem gets added to the contextMenus, but it's not

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
good enough just to add that, we need to create an event handler so that we can listen to any onClicked event

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
or any time a menuItem is clicked. So we're going to do chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So now we're going to specify a function that has clickData and we're going to basically execute this

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
function whenever a context menu item is clicked. So what we want to do here is first we want to check to

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
make sure this is our menu item, so we're going to say if(clickData.menuItemId == "addProtein".

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So if it's our menuItem &amp;&amp;, we're going to make sure that there's actually some selection text,

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
so let's do clickData.selectionText. So as long as we have some text then we're good to go.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And the way that I know what's available on clickData is, again, you can check that API documentation for

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the chrome APIs, and for the onClicked, it shows you what clickData has in it.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There's a bunch of different properties that you can get about the menu item.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So now what we want to do is we want to make sure that this is a number, so I'm going to actually use

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the regex here; I'm just going to say intRegex. There's a lot of different ways you can check for a number,

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but this is a sure way to make sure that you have a number. And then we're going to go ahead and say,

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
if(intRegex.test, that'll test to see if whatever we passed in here conforms to this regex, and we're going

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to get clickData.selectionText. So we're actually going to get the text that's selected.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So if that is a number then what we want to do is create a variable called newTotal, but before we do that,

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
let's go ahead and do a get on the existing total. We're going to create some logic sort of like what we

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
created before when we added the amount to the total, so let's do our chrome.storage.sync.get and then we

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
want to get the total, and then we're going to specify our callback here, so we're going to say function(items)

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and then inside here we're going to say var newTotal = 0 and then we're going to check if(items.total.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So if there is a total, then we'll go ahead and do newTotal += parseInt(items.total), so we'll go ahead

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and add that to our new total. And then we can do a newTotal += parseInt(clickData.selectionText),

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
so we know that the selectionText is actually an integer, and if that's the case, then we can just add

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that to our new total. So this is going to effectively increment our total by whatever the text that's selected,

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
by whatever that number is. So then we just need to save this, so we'll do chrome.storage.sync.set, and

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
then we'll create our object here with the total property and we'll set it equal to newTotal.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay, so that should be it. Now this should run when our event page runs, so we'll end up getting this

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
contextMenus.create, that'll create our menuItem, and then we'll subscribe to this onClicked for contextMenus.
