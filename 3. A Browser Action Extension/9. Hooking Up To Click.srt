00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so I'm here in the popup.js in the Editor and what we want to do here is we want to make it so that

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that click button does something, so that's the first thing that we're going to do is we're just going to

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
test this to make sure it works. I'm just going to use an alert to show an alert box that shows that we've

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:28,000
hooked up this click. So, we're just going to do our jQuery $(function, to have this function start or run

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
when the page loads up, and then inside here we're going to hook up our event handler, so we're just going

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to do #addAmount and we're going to say when it's clicked, execute the following function, and inside here,

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
all we're going to do for now is just we're going to say alert(â€˜clicked').

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So now we just want to verify that this is going to work, so I'm just going to go ahead and

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
open up a browser window and I'm just going to click this and then click the Add Protein button.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You can see that it says clicked, so we know that we're hooked up correctly.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You always want to take these small steps whenever you're doing something like this because you don't want

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to end up putting a lot of code in here and then trying to debug that; by doing this really small step,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know that this popup.js is being loaded and that it's hooking up to this click and everything is working.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So now I'm ready to take the next step.
