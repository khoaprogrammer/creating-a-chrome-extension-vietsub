The extension we created in this module had a lot more functionality than our first extension.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We made use of many useful chrome APIs, like the Storage APIs and the Notification APIs, and we even used

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
an event page to be able to register for events when our extension first loaded, but in many cases,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you'll want to create an extension that is not visible on the toolbar for every page, because it may not

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
apply to every single page. In those cases, you can use a Page Action Extension to just show the action

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that is available for a certain page. We'll be using a combination of a page action in content scripts

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to implement our next extension. Thanks for joining me, and take care.
