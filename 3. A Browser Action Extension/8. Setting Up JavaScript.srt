00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so now it's time to actually implement this functionality to be able to actually add some protein and

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to save that data, but before we can do that, we're going to need to go ahead and create our JavaScript files

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and bring in our jQuery. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to link to our JavaScript and then we'll

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
create that JavaScript file, so we're just going to say script src = and we're just going to call this popup.js

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then we're also going to want to link our jQuery, so let's do a script src = jQuery and let me go ahead

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and copy this entire string. Okay, so now we'll need to add these to our directory.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's go ahead and go to our directory and I'm going to go ahead and just copy the jQuery instance that

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we already downloaded before, so I've got the jQuery file already, and then we're just going to create a new file

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we're going to just call this popup.js and then we'll need to go ahead and edit this and then create

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that functionality.
