1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So next we're going to go ahead and create our

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
user interface, our basic popup.html, so we're just going to create a ‘New Text Document' and we're just

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
going to call this popup.html and we're going to go ahead and open this one up in Visual Studio to edit it

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and what we want to do here is design the user interface for our main popup, so this will be when you click

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the icon for our extension, it should show this UI. We're just going to make a real simple user interface.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You could, of course, make something more complicated if you want to, but we're just going to create an HTML document

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:53,000
with our doctype html and then inside here, of course, we have our html and then our head and then our body.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And what we're going to put inside here is we're just going to put in h1, that will say Protein Tracker,

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then we'll add some h2's for everything else we're going to have in here.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So let's have a total and then let's make a span here so that we can actually set this total to some value,

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so we're going to give this an id of total and we're going to set it to 0 by default.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We'll do the same thing here for the goal, so we'll put Goal, and then we're going to add an h3 for ‘Enter amount.'

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we'll say Enter amount and then we want to have an input that we'll call amount and this will be of type text.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So that will let us have our little text input there and then we want a button for someone to go ahead and

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
submit this to enter the values, so we're just going to make this addAmount and we're going to make the type

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
equal to submit and then the value, this'll be what it says, it'll say Add Protein.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, and then we want to go ahead and add a title, this'll actually end up being a tool tip for our extension

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
when you hover over it, so we'll call this Protein Tracker, and we're going to add some script files,

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but we're not going to add those yet, we're just going to leave this as is, and remember that little trick

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that I showed you in the last module - we can use that here to look at our user interface.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In fact, I found that if you have two monitors, you can actually leave this open on one and then make your

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
edits in your HTML and you'll see them change here automatically, so this is kind of a quick way to do a

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
preview of your HTML and the nice thing about this is it works regardless of what editor you're using.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So we have a real simple user interface; the basic idea here is that we're going to have the Total here

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that we can swap out, the Goal that we can swap out, the user should be able to enter some amount, and

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
then be able to click this Add Protein, and it will make it so that it adds that amount to the total.
