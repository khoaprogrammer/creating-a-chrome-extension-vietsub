1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so now before we can test this we have to do something special here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With HTML and JavaScript, if you change those files, you don't really have to do anything because their

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
changes are going to be automatically reflected, but since we've added a permission, we actually have to go

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
here into Extensions and we have to click this Reload to reload the extension

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and that's going to make sure that it gets that new permission that is needed for it.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, now if we go to our extension and we type in an amount, click Add, you can see that it adds the protein,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but you'll notice one problem here - so if we close our extension and then reopen this UI, it doesn't show

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
us the total, so we can fix that real quick. What we need to do is load that amount when our page first loads.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, all we have to do is inside here we're going to go ahead and do a chrome.storage.sync.get and then here

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:08,000
again we're just going to do this just like we did before, get our total, and then do function (items) and

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
then inside here what we want to do is we want to basically just set the (â€˜#total').text equal to items.total.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So now I can go ahead and save that and let's make sure that this is closed, and now if we open up our extension,

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you can see that the Total automatically is showing up and it's going to reflect whatever the current total is.
