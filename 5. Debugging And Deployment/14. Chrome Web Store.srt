00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now deploying to the Chrome Web Store definitely has fewer pitfalls.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All you need to do to deploy to the Chrome Web Store is log into the Chrome Developer Dashboard and upload

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the Extension directory. Even most of the details on the Extensions Product page are optional, although you

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
should probably fill them out if you want someone to actually be able to find and use your extension.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
From the Chrome Web Store, you can even do a semi-private deployment by making it so your extension only

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is accessible through a direct link and it's not searchable in the store.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'll take you through the basics of this process next.
