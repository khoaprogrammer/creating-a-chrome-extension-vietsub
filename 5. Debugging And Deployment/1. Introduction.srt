Hi, this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight, and in this module we'll be learning about how to Debug and Deploy

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
our Chrome Extensions. One thing you may have encountered while trying to create an extension is something

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
going wrong and not knowing how to figure it out. Extensions operate mostly in the background, so they can

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
be difficult to troubleshoot if you don't know how. Fortunately, debugging extensions is not that hard and

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we'll go through the process of seeing how to debug extensions we've created using the Chrome Dev Tools.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And once you've got your extensions working the way you want, you'll probably want to be able to deploy an extension.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll show you everything you need to know about packaging up your finished extension and either hosting it

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
on your own website for distribution or putting it in the Chrome Web Store.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
By the end of this module, you should know everything you need to know to create, debug, and deploy chrome extensions.
