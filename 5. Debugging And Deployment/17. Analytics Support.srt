You can actually use Google Analytics in your actual extension, so you can track things like page views,

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
as well as events that happen in your extension so you can see how users are using your extension.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're not going to go over the details of that in this course, but if you do want to find out more you can go

00:00:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
