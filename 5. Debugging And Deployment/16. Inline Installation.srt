00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now this is one of my favorite ways to deploy your extension. This approach is a combination approach we

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
talked about earlier; the official name is the inline installation.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this case, we'll host our extension with the Chrome Web Store, but we'll add some code to our page to

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
allow a user to install it directly from our site. To do this, it's not very hard at all.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
First, you need to, of course, have your extension deployed in the Chrome Web Store, then you just add the

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
link in your head tag of your page that links to the Chrome Web Store with your extensions unique ID.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Finally, you can just call chrome.webstore.install to allow the user to install the extension in some JavaScript code.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are a couple of other restrictions that you should know about though.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
First, you need to make sure your site is verified with the Google Site Master Tools, and second,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the user has to initiate the action for your call to chrome.webstore.install.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So in other words, you can't just run this script when someone comes to your page; they have to click

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a button or do something else to initiate it. You can find the complete documentation with all the details

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:59:00,000
at this link, but it's pretty simple and easy to do.
