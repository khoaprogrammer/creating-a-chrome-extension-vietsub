Well we've finally reached the end of this course. We've covered many of the features of Chrome Extensions

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and seen the power of Chrome Extensions as we've created our own extensions, both Browser Action Extensions

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that are always available and Page Action Extensions designed to work on certain pages or certain conditions.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We also saw how easy it is to use the Chrome Extensions to modify an existing page and finally how to debug

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and deploy them. I hope you've enjoyed this course.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I really like how easy it is to use and create Chrome Extensions and I find that they're really powerful ways

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of extending Chrome and even adding extra capabilities to web pages that you wouldn't otherwise be able to alter.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Good luck creating your own Chrome Extensions, and thanks for watching! Take care.
