00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Alright, so let's take a look at the Chrome Developer Dashboard and how we would actually upload an app.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So the easiest way to get there is probably just to type in chrome developer dashboard into Google,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
because you can see the URL here is chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so that's a little bit hard to type in.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And when you go there, you'll need to authenticate with a Google account, so you can see that I'm signed

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in to my main Gmail account. And let's go ahead and go back to the Dashboard, and here at this Dashboard,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you can see any of the extensions I've already published or apps, chrome web store apps, I just have the

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Pluralsight Helper, which I've already tried to publish, so I've already just put this out here and it can be

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
accessed from a link and we have some information about the developer account and some basic settings you can modify.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now all you have to do is click this ‘Add new Item',

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and then it'll have you upload an extension or app and it says a .zip file, so one thing to make note of

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
here is this first item - it says "Upload a ZIP file of your item directory, not a packaged CRX file."

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So you don't want to upload the CRX file, and part of the reason for that is because the web store's

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
actually going to package it for you, and remember, we have this whole signing with the private key,

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
well it's going to be signing it based on some security credentials on your Google account so that you won't

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
have to actually include your own private key. Just by uploading your app or your extension through your account,

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Google will know that it's you. So, what we're going to do is we're just going to go to

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
our directory and all we basically have to do in here is to zip this up.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I'm just going to go to Creating Chrome Extension, let's go ahead and do, let's say our Protein Tracker.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I'm just going to do a zip here, just ProteinTracker.zip, so now I have this zip file and all I'm going

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to do is choose this file. So I'm just going to go in here and we will find our

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
ProteinTracker.zip, then we just click Upload,

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and then it will take us to our Edit Items screen where we can edit everything here, and it has pretty good descriptions.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can see that I don't have an icon so it's not showing my icon here.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We can put in our detailed description, we can upload a new icon here, and it has all the details about

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the particular icon sizes. There's a lot here to pay attention to if you want to get everything just right,

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but it's really important if you're making an extension that's going to be downloaded by other people and

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you want to have it look nice, you'll probably want to follow all these instructions.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Same thing with the screenshots; you can link to a YouTube video, which is probably a good idea to show

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
how to use your extension. It also has these Promotional tile images; these are those images that you see

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
in the Chrome Web Store; again, good if you're trying to market this.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then the tile previews. And then here is an important part — this is where you verify that this is

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
an item for your website. So, it's going to show me any of the verified sites that I have connected with

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
this account, so my simpleprogrammer.com, for example, I could use that here.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can also put a link to my website or to my Support in FAQ for this chrome extension if I have one here.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then you want to select a category and this can be whatever category that you have.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's put this under Fun and then you can decide what regions you want your extension to be available in.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The language; you do have to select a language. A lot of these other options are optional, you don't have

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to specify a lot of these things, but you do need a language. And then you can actually hook up your Google Analytics here.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now what this will do is this is going to basically just track the usage of this extension, but not the usage

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
inside the extension. What I mean is you're going to be able to track how many people are downloading and

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
using the extension, not actually what they're doing in the extension.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then we have any requirements that are specified in the manifest file and then this little thing for

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ads behavior. If you're injecting ads, that's probably not a good idea, but --- and then the visibility options here.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now this is going to control how you're going to be able to distribute this.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, the default is all Chrome Web Store users; that's going to make it so your extension is visible just

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in the Chrome Web Store. You can just say people with the link, which will hide it so that someone has to

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
has to have the link. It's not a secure way of having your app be in the web store — you can't count on

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
no one being able to get access to it that you don't allow, but this is a way to; for example, if you have

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a company extension but you want to distribute it through the Chrome Web Store, this is a great way to do it

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
because it's not going to show up when people search for it. And then trusted testers; you can set up

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
tester accounts that you can manage from that Developer Dashboard and you can just set this up just for

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
people to be able to test it. So then all you have to do is you can either Save draft and return to

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Dashboard or you can just preview it or publish it right here.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So we could actually save our draft and we could click Publish if we want to publish this;

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not going to publish this at this point, because we don't really want to actually publish this, but that's

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
pretty much it. It's really simple, really easy to get this setup and to get an extension in the Chrome Web Store.
