Okay, so the last thing that I want to show you about debugging extensions is if you're trying to reach

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a page in your extension that's sort of hard to reach. You can always do this chrome-extension: //,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then the extension ID, and then the actual filename, and then it will show up directly in the browser -

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you can just browse to this. So, for example, if we go to our

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Settings Extensions, you can see that each extension has this ID.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So we can find, let's say our Pluralsight Helper, we could just replace this here, and then go to popup.html,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and this will show up in here as well.
