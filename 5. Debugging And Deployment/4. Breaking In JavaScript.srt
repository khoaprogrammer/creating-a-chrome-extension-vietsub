00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's look at an example of how you might actually utilize this to figure out something that might be

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
going on here; so for example, what we can do here with our Protein Tracker is we can go to our Sources

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and this popup.js, and from here, we can actually make some changes or set breakpoints.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, let's go ahead and just set a breakpoint here and let's say that we want to figure out what's going on.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's set a breakpoint, let's say right there. So now what we can do is we can basically type in something here

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and click this â€˜Add Protein' and you'll see that we're hitting this breakpoint, so we're actually debugging

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this in this JavaScript debugger, and we can do all kinds of things like we can look at our scope variables.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So here we have our local variable, so we can see what the amount - it's set to 123, we can see our items,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we can basically go through here and even step through this if we wanted to.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And we're not going to go through all of the features of the Chrome Developer Tools here, but you basically

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
have the entire capability of the Chrome Developer Tools at your disposal to be able to debug these extensions.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So if you know how to use the Chrome Developer Tools, and I'll show you in a minute a resource that you can

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
use to find out more about it, but if you do use the Chrome Developer Tools, you'll find that debugging

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
an extension really isn't much different than debugging any web page.
