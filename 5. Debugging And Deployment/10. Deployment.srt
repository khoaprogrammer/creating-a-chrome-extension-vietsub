00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There are three main options for deploying your extension, we'll cover each of these in detail, but let's

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
go over them from a high level first. The first option is self-hosted.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
With this option, you are creating your own extension package and putting it somewhere for users to access

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and install in Chrome. There are certain security requirements you have to be aware of for this option,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but we'll talk about those in a little bit. Next up is normal Chrome Web Store deployment.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In this case, you put your extension in the Chrome Web Store where users can either browse to find it or

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
use a specific link to download and install it. Updates are also automatically handled in this case,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
just like Chrome updates happen automatically for the browser itself.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Finally, we have a combination, where you put your extension in the Chrome Web Store, but you actually let

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
users install the extension from your own site. In this scenario, you maintain control over the distribution

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of your extension, but you get the benefits in security of the Chrome Web Store hosting it for you.
