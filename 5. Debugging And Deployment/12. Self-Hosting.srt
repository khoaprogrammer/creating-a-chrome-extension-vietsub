00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Self-hosting is not quite as easy as it used to be, as the newer versions of Chrome have made it more

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
difficult to install an extension that isn't from the Chrome Web Store.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As a result, you should only really use self-hosting if you have to, because it's more difficult and

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
error-prone than the other options, plus it's less secure for users.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Extensions, of course, can do many bad things, so it makes sense that Google would encourage using the

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Chrome Web Store for distribution, but if you do want to do self-hosting or you have to, here are some

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
things to be aware of. First, you'll want to configure autoupdate in your manifest file.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can find instructions on how to do this here. It involves creating an entry in your manifest file,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
as well as creating another xml manifest that you use to indicate what the current version is and where

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to download the extension. This will ensure that your extension gets updated automatically.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When using web store, you don't have to worry about this. Next, you need to allow your extension to be

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
installed from your site. By default, Chrome blocks all extensions from being installed that don't have

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
explicit permissions specified for the domain that extension is coming from.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You could follow this link to see how to set those permissions for each operating system.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This requirement is probably the biggest reason self-hosting is a hassle; it requires actually modifying

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the Chrome install itself. Next, you need to make sure you keep your private key that was used when you

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
packaged the extension. This is required to update the extension.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And finally, you can actually install an extension without the extra security change to the extension

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
install source if it's manually done. This can be done by opening up the Settings page in Chrome and

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
manually dragging the crx file into it. If you have to have your extension self-hosted and you can't

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:59:00,000
modify the extension install source for the user's Chrome installation, you may need to resort to this approach.
