00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Alright, so let's go ahead and see how we can actually debug some of our extensions.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, if you already are familiar with the Chrome Developer Tools, you may have used them on a web page,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so for example, I could right-click on something here and say ‘Inspect element' and this would bring them up

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and I can also just bring up the Chrome Developer Tools from either the menu if I go under Tools and then

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
go to Developer tools or the JavaScript console, but you may have used these tools to debug web pages,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to change the html or the CSS or just to go through the JavaScript and figure out what's going on and

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you may have found that you're not actually seeing the extension JavaScript or the extension HTML inside here.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, you can actually use the Chrome Developer Tools, but you just need a different instance.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, for example, let's take a look at our Protein Tracker extension.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I were to right-click in here, I can do an ‘Inspect element' and this will work.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can also just right-click on the extension itself in the toolbar and say ‘Inspect popup' and that will go

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
ahead and bring up the popup, as well as another Chrome Developer Tool console.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So this one is actually operating against this particular page; so if we were to go to Elements here,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you can see that it is working for our popup, our user interface here, and then from here we could look at

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
our sources and we can find all of the actual source here; this popup.js, for example, and we can do

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
anything we want with this JavaScript. So, just being able to see what's loaded up is step one,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that's one really useful thing to be able to do to debug an extension.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In many cases you can figure out what's going wrong with your extension by looking here and seeing if

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there's something missing, is this JavaScript correct, can you see what's happening with this HTML?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
For example, you could go in here and you could change the HTML or the CSS styling if you wanted to.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So let's go ahead and change the style for this; for example, let's say that the element.style for this

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
should be font-size and we'll make this small, so you can see that this actually changes to small.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So that's how we get at our actual extension when we have this visible page UI.
