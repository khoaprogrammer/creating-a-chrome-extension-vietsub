00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now let's see how we can create an actual extension package; right now we've been using our extensions just

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
by pointing Chrome at a directory and it's been reading it from there, but you may want to actually pack

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
your extension, either to do self-hosting or just to test it out, maybe you want to be able to give it to

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
someone to be able to test it. So what we can do here is from Extensions, we can just click this

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
‘Pack Extension' and this is pretty easy.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
All we're going to do is just browse to where our Extension directory is, so in my case it's under here,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we're going to take, let's say, our Pluralsight Helper and we'll just click OK,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then when I click ‘Pack Extension', it's going to go ahead and it's created this .crx file and it's also

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
created this PluralsightHelper.pem - this is my key file. This is important to keep because it is a private key

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that was used to sign this extension. So if I want to update this, I need to have this file.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's go ahead and take a look here.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now on the file system you can see we have this crx and we have this .pem, and the crx file format is

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
actually a zip file format that has a header that has some additional information in it as well.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And now let's say that I made some changes to my extension; let's say that I update the version number

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in my manifest file, so let's go ahead and edit this real quick.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And let's say we have a new version, we have version 1.1. So now I could just save this

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then I'm going to want to update this,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
so what I would do is just do ‘Pack my extension' and then I would actually browse

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to this private key file,

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and now when I click ‘Pack Extension', it of course gives me a warning that there's already a cx file

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
present with this name and I'm going to proceed anyway,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and so now I have my updated extension. So that's how to pack it; it's really, really easy to do.
