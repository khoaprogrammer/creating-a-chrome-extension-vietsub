Hi, this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight and welcome to this course on Creating Chrome Extensions.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Chrome extensions are a useful way to add functionality to the Chrome web browser which can come in handy

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in a variety of different contexts. You can use Chrome extensions to integrate capabilities of your application

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or service directly into Chrome or you can create Chrome extensions that add useful functionality to Chrome itself

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and even modify web pages browsed with Chrome on the fly. In this course I'll take you through the surprisingly

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
easy process of creating Chrome extensions. We'll learn the basics about Chrome extensions and how they work.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And create our own extensions. We'll create both an extension that uses a user interface and one that works in the

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
background to add capabilities to webpages in the browser. So, if you've always wanted to create

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Chrome extensions, but you didn't know where to get started, or you thought it might be too hard,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
keep watching and I'll show you just how easy it is.
