00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
As we talked about earlier, Chrome extensions use common web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to extend the capabilities of the Chrome browser. Chrome extensions work by extending the capabilities

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of Chrome via some extension points which are defined in a manifest file that comes with extension

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and through the use of JavaScript Chrome APIs. A Chrome behaves sort of like a JavaScript application

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that Chrome runs and evokes at certain points which the developer of the extension can specify.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Chrome extensions can even run in the background and listen for events to trigger them.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here is the basic process of how Chrome extensions are created and added to a browser.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Fist, a developer creates the extension using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are many ways these three technologies can be used to create an extension.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And a developer has access to many of the internal capabilities of Chrome through the Chrome APIs

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which can be accessed from JavaScript. Then the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files are packaged together

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
with a manifest file that specifies important information about how the extension should work and what files

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
it contains. This is all packaged into a zipped file with the .CRX extension.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Typically, at this point, the CRX file is deployed to either the Chrome Web Store or some other location

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that users can access and download the extension from. We'll cover how to do this in the last module.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then finally, the extension is installed into the user's browser.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Chrome automatically recognizes the .CRX extension and knows how to unpack it and read the manifest file

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to determine how exactly to integrate the extension into the browser.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
At this point, the extension is completely installed on the user's machine and integrated with the browser.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is important because it's a common misconception that Chrome extensions run from the web.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Because they seem to magically appear when you install Chrome on another computer and sign in with your

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Google account. And that's it! At a very basic level Chrome extensions really are that simple.
