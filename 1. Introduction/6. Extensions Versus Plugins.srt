00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I mentioned that I'd show you the difference between extension and a plugin just so you could see for yourself.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, let's go ahead and take a quick look. So, it you do a chrome://extensions

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you'll see all of the extensions here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But, just to show you they are different, if you do chrome://plugins

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you'll see that this is quite different. In fact, you have Adobe Flash Player as a common plugin

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that ships with Chrome. And here if you hit this you can see the details, but your default view would be here

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
where you don't see the details. But, you can see that these are actual plugins and plugins are different

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
than extensions. These are going to be accessing your computer outside of the sandbox.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This could be a lot more dangerous. In fact, a lot of vulnerabilities come through the Flash plugin.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you've heard of some of the exploits that have happened with some of the common browsers,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
a lot of times it's through a plugin.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, you can see that plugins are definitely not the preferred way to extend the capabilities of Chrome.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, sometimes you do need a plugin, sometimes you don't have a choice and you can, through an extension,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
register a plugin, but we're not going to cover that in this course.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It is a rare occurrence though unless you're doing something like creating your own Flash Player or something

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of the level of, for example, the Microsoft Office plugin which is able to launch Microsoft Office

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
documents from Chrome and things like that, you probably don't need to create a plugin.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can probably create an extension instead which is a lot easier to do and is a lot safer.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, if you want to ever see the difference, you can just go to extensions or plugins and here you can

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
manage either one of them.
