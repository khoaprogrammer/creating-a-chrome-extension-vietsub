1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This course is broken up into five modules which will take us through the basics, the creation of

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
three Chrome extensions, and then finally, the important issues of debugging in deployment.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll start with the first module which you're currently watching in which we'll discuss the basics of

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Chrome extensions and how they work. And discover just how much you can actually do with some simple

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
JavaScript code thanks to Chrome's extensive APIs.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then in Module 2, we'll create our first extension. This extension won't do much, it'll be a basic

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello World extension, but it will give us a chance to go over the basics of the mechanical process

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of creating an extension and learn how the different technologies and pieces fit together to

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
create the final Chrome extension bundle. This module should help you gain the confidence that creating an

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
actual extension itself is pretty easy.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Once we have created a basic extension, it'll be time to do something a little more useful.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In Module 3 we'll create a browser action extension which is just an extension that will give an icon

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in the browser that can be clicked to display a UI. You've probably seen many of these types of extensions

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
before because they are the most common and most obvious types of extensions.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then in Module 4 we'll create a page action extension. This kind of extension runs in the back ground and

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
modifies a web page by adding capabilities to it. It isn't as prominent as a browser action extension,

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but it is a very powerful capability of Chrome extensions that can do some pretty awesome things.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In Module 5 we'll learn two important things about Chrome extensions.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
First, how to debug them using the Chrome developer tools, and then how to deploy them.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We'll see how we can package up a Chrome extension and submit it to the Chrome Web Store so that

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
others can download it and make use of it.
