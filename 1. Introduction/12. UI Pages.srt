UI pages are just HTML pages that display a UI for an extension. If you've installed any Chrome extensions,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
this is probably the part of an extension you're most familiar with because it's the most visible part.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A UI page is usually displayed when a user clicks the extensions icon in the toolbar.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Browser actions which are the Icons that appear in the toolbar can have a pop-up which is an HTML page

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that's displayed when the browser action's clicked.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Option pages can also be specified to customize an extension. UI pages can even override default pages in

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the Chrome browser or be displayed dynamically by JavaScript code in the extension that opens a new tab or window.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
UI pages in an extension can access and manipulate each other by changing properties on their DOMs.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
UI pages can even invoke functions on a background page, if needed.
