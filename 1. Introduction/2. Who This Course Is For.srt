One of the nice things about Chrome extensions is that they're actually very easy to create.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Chrome extensions are made using web technologies you're already probably familiar with like, HTML, CSS,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and JavaScript. That means that just about anyone with some basic web skills, regardless of their primary

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
programing language background, or choice of technology stack, can learn to create Chrome extensions.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You'll need to be at least somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get the most out of this

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
course though, since we won't be covering the basics here. Other than that small requirement,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
this course is basically for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're a .NET developer or Java developer or

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
even prefer Ruby or Python. Since Chrome extensions only use the web technologies, everything in this course

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
will apply equally well. Another benefit of Chrome's easy to create extensions are that you can learn to

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
create extensions for a variety of different reasons. Unlike some technologies that require deep

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
understanding of a framework and lots of study. The simplicity of this topic opens up the possibility of

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
creating Chrome extensions for just even personal use. Plus, as an added bonus, you'll look like a genius

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:59:00,000
when you show your boss the Chrome extensions you made over the weekend for your specific software.
