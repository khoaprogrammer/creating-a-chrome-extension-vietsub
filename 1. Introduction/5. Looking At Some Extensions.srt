00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I want to show you a couple of different extensions just so you can get a basic idea of what

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
a Chrome extension is. So, you've probably already installed extensions in Chrome if you've used Chrome.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But, maybe you haven't. If you haven't ever installed any extensions in Chrome, you can usually find

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
extensions by going to the Chrome Web Store. So, if you go to chrome web store.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Inside here, this is a good place to find extensions if you just go to extension here.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And if you're not familiar with extensions already, I encourage you to take a look through here.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Especially if you use Chrome, there's quite a few really good extensions in here.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In fact, I need to go back through here and see if there's anything new that I might be able to utilize

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that I've been missing. A lot of times extensions can really enhance the usage of Chrome because it can

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
give you some capabilities baked right into the browser that can really come in handy.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For example, I have a couple of extensions installed; one of them is the School of Voice extension

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which I really like a lot because it lets me access my Google voice messages right here

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and to even call and text someone.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then I have this Bookmarking extension that automatically adds to my bookmark.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And so this is a pretty neat extension and this just shows you some of the capabilities of the extension

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
framework in Chrome. So for example, when I click this, it brings up my bookmarks and I can search it.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, this has the extensions UI, but it also integrates

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
directly into this Omni bar in Chrome. So, if I hit * and then I type here.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, I do let's say .NET. You can see that's actually searching my bookmarks and it's going to show me

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
what bookmarks are matching here. So, I can actually go to a bookmark directly from here.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can see that is shows this Neat Bookmarks.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, extensions really have a lot of different capabilities that we can utilize and we'll talk about

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
these more later. But, this should just you a basic idea of what extensions look like most of the time

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you're interacting with them here in the browser. But, extensions don't actually have to be here in this

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
toolbar, some extensions are going to be running in the background and you won't actually even see them.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can always see all the extensions that are running inside Chrome by going to this Manage here.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Or just doing chrome://extensions, you can just go to this in your browser and you'll see all your extensions.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And here you can actually see the Permissions for the extension, go to the website, you can allow them in

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
incognito mode and set the options on that. Or you can enable or you can delete the extensions.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, you can see all the different extensions that I have here.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, if you're not familiar with extensions at all, if you haven't ever used them in Chrome, I encourage you

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to go to the Chrome Web Store and try a couple of extensions. Install them and get an idea of what extensions

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
can do and what extensions are out there before you continue with this course,

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
because that will help you when you're trying to learn about extensions.
