Okay, so now you know what a Chrome extension is and a bit about how Chrome extensions work.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But, what exactly can you do with a Chrome extension? Chrome extensions are actually very powerful and can

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
do more than you might think. Let's go over some of the obvious and the not so obvious things you can do

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
with a Chrome extension. First of all, you can interact with web pages in the browser or external web pages

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and/or other servers. This means that you can have an extension interact with APIs or other services to

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
perform its functionality. You aren't restricted to just what you can package in your extension file.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can also control many of the browser features available in Chrome.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We'll take a look at the Chrome APIs in a minute, but there're pretty extensive and really lets you do a lot

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
more than you might have thought possible. For example, through the Chrome APIs you can access things the

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Font settings, Tabs, Downloads, and even History. You can also add your own UI to Chrome through the use of

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
either a Chrome Browser action or Page action. Browser actions show a button on the Chrome toolbar that can

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
be pressed to display a custom UI. And page actions can put icons in the address bar that can be clicked to

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
access a user interface for actions specific to that page. In addition, your extension can have its own

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
options page where it can be configured through your own custom UI.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Extensions can modify loaded pages by injecting JavaScript into the page to add capabilities to the page or

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
even change the UI of it. You can also use extensions to add context menu items to the right-click

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
context menu in Chrome. Finally, Chrome extensions can actually load DLLs.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Although this is something you typically want to avoid since it's pretty dangerous and causes an extension to

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
leave the safe sandbox environment of Chrome. Doing this actually creates a real plugin using the NPAPI,

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but we won't be covering that in this course.
