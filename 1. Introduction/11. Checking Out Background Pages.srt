00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, I want to show you how you can check out the background pages that are running inside of Chrome.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And also, just another tool that you can utilize when you're developing your extensions that you'll

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
probably find useful for checking the memory requirements and seeing what's running.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, if you go to your Chrome options here and then go to tools, you can see this Task Manager.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now this shows you more than just the background pages.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It shows you your actual browser and the tabs and then any apps that are running.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And also, your extensions themselves and how much memory they're taking up.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is pretty useful information. But you can also see here something's like the background page if you have

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
different background pages running. And you can see how much memory those background pages are taking.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, this is really useful for figuring out exactly what's going on.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And it shows you which background pages are running. So, if you're wondering why your browser's running so slow,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or why it's taking up so much memory, when you look in here and you see how many extensions are actually

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
taking up a large amount of memory, that's your answer.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So the more extensions that you install, the more that you're going to be using up memory with Chrome.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And you want to be careful with that when you create your own extension; you probably want to look in here

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and check out the memory requirements of that extension. Especially if you're using a background page,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
you can see that some background pages can take up quite a bit of memory.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In fact, I have a background page for this REST console, and it doesn't even really make sense.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not using the REST console activity, so it might make sense to disable this extension.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This extension probably really doesn't need a background page because I can't imagine why it's using one

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
at this point when I'm not even using the REST console in my browser.
