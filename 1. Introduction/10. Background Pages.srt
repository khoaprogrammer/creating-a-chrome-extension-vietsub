Chrome extensions can be generally broken up into three main parts.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A background page, UI pages, and content scripts. Let's talk about each one of these important components

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in a little more detail.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
First we have background pages. A Chrome extensions can have a background page which is basically an HTML page

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that runs in the background. Typically, a background page will have some JavaScript code in it

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that will be used to control the capabilities of the extension when it's active from the Chrome UI.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can actually see a list of the background pages running from Chrome using the Chrome Task Manager

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
as you can see here. Background pages can either be persistent or event pages.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Persistence background pages are always running in open.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This can be necessary when you have a background page that stores some persistent state for your extensions

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
or handles some long running process to manage a task. But, background pages can be resource hogs so they

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
should be used carefully. Often a better approach is to use an event page which is only loaded when it's needed.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Event pages work just like background pages, except that they don't persist themselves all the time.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Instead, an event page is registered for a specific event which will trigger it and cause it to become active.
