00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Content scripts are scripts that are executed when certain pages load in the browser.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These scripts can be used to essentially inject JavaScript into a page to modify its behavior or user interface.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The content script essentially becomes part of the page that was loaded.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This means a content script is going to behave like any other script on the page.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, content scripts can't directly modify the DOM of the HTML pages packaged with the extension,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
like UI pages and background pages can. But, content scripts can send messages back to the parent extension

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to ask pages in the paired extension to modify a UI page or perform some extension-related functionality.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Likewise, a background page or UI page can send a message to a content script to cause it to perform an action

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
on the page it's running on. We'll look more at content scripts when we utilize them to implement an

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
extension in Module 4.
