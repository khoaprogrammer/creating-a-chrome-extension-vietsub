00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now you should have the basic knowledge about Chrome extensions needed to create our own extensions.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Chrome extensions are basically just a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript packaged with a manifest file

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that tells Chrome how to integrate their functionality into the browser.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But, as we talked about in this module, extensions are pretty powerful and can utilize the Chrome APIs to

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
control and manipulate many aspects of the browser. We also talked about the three parts of the

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Chrome extension; the background pages, UI pages, and content scripts.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But we'll be looking more in depth into each of these as we utilize them and some of the extensions we'll

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
be creating later in this course. Up next, we'll be creating a very basic Hello World extension to see how

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
all the technology of a Chrome extension works and get you familiar with working with extensions before we

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
get into the details of the Chrome API or the JavaScript code used to interact with it.

Thanks for joining me and take care.
