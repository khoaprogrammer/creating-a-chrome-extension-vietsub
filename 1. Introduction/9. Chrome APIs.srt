1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now I did want to show you where you can get access to information about the Chrome APIs that we're going to

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
be using in the course and I want to give you a quick overview of what's available just so you can see

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
how powerful the Chrome APIs are and how much you can actually do with your extensions.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, if you go to developers.google.com it will take you to this page and here you can click on Chrome extensions.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From here you can read about extensions, we're going to cover a lot of this material in this course,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but one thing that you might want to check out is this Reference portion here.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This has some really useful information. Specifically let's look at this chrome.*APIs.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, this is all of the APIs that are available through Chrome. And here you can see that there are quite a

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
few different things in here that you can access.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For example, we could go to events and then you can see that we have this chrome.events.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And this gives some documentation on the chrome.events API to basically let you subscribe to events.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, you can utilize this in yours extensions. And it has some good documentation on all of this.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, you can go through this chrome.*APIs to find out exactly what you can do with Chrome.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Chances are if there is something in Chrome that you want to do with your extension, you can probably

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
find out how to do it through here.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can access really most of Chrome through this.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And throughout this course we'll just be using a sub-set of the Chrome APIs.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's so much of the Chrome APIs, obviously we can't cover all of them in this course.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But, once you know how to use some of the basic APIs, it'll be easy to go to this page and look at any other

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
APIs that you want to use and figure out how to use those.
