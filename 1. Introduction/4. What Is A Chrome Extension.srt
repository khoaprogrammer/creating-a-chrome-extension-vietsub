00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start off by talking about what exactly a Chrome extension is.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Chrome extensions really can be thought of as the way Google provides for extending the capabilities of Chrome.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Extensions are often confused with plugins which are quite different.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Many developers mistakenly confuse them as the same, but in a minute I'll show you the difference in Chrome itself.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There is quite a bit of debate across the web about the actual differences,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but the easy way to conceptualize it is to think of plugins as running outside of the sandbox context of

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the browser and interacting with the browser. Extensions on the other hand, run within the browser

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and conform to a specific set of APIs and capabilities exposed by Chrome.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This isn't to say that a Chrome extension can't ever do anything bad and it completely safe,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but you have a lot more assurance with most Chrome extensions that they're going to be safe to run,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
especially if the extension is obtained from the Chrome Web Store.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Chrome extensions can be used for a variety of different purposes and can behave differently.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But, in general, Chrome extensions somehow expand the capabilities of the browser.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This could be through the creation of a sort of in-browser app that's accessed from the Chrome toolbar,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
complete with its own UI, through injecting JavaScript into loaded pages,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or even changing some of the default behaviors of Chrome.
