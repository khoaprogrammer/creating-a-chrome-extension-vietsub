00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so now let's go ahead and create our HTML file. Remember that we need to have a popup.html, that is

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
what we had specified in our manifest.json.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, I'm just going to do a new text document.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I'm just going to call this popup.html.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then we're just going to edit this HTML page.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So again, I'm opening this up in Visual Studio, but you can use whatever editor that you'd like.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And remember, this is just a basic HTML document. So, I'm just going to do the doc-type declaration

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so, doctype html. And then I'm going to add the HTML tag.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then we want to have a head, and inside our head we're going to add a title.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And we'll just call this Hello World. And then inside here we could add some styling if we wanted to.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And we can add our scripts in here, but right now let's go ahead and finish creating the rest of this.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, let's put after our head, our body. And then for our page, let's actually just make an h1.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And we'll give this an ID, we'll call this greeting. And then we'll default this to be hi.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And then let's go ahead and make an input box here so, we're going to say input=name for the ID

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then the type will be equal to text. So, we'll have one text input box and that's it.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That'll be our basic HTML page. And a little tip here, if you use Windows,

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you can actually set up your preview mode in Windows so that when you click on an HTML file,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
it'll show you the preview of it and actually render that HTML which is pretty neat.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Especially when you're designing some HTML like this where you can't easily just test this out

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
in the actual extension. You can just open this up in a browser as well if you want to.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But the way that you do this is just go to Organize and then Layout and then check this Preview pane.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You'll notice that if I turn that off and then I go back in here and turn this on, it'll show that preview.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I tend to like this for a lot of different files that'll give you a preview which is nice.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
For a video, it actually gives you a video player here that you can click Play.
