1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, the first thing that we'll need to do to create our extension is to go ahead and create a folder

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that we're going to create the extension in. So, we're just going to create a folder here called Hello World.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And inside here we're going to place all of our files.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the file that we're going to start with is our manifest file.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, I'm just going to go ahead and create a New Text Document.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I'm just going to call this manifest.json.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, let's go ahead and edit this. Now, you can edit this in any editor that you like.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to go ahead and use Visual Studio.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, just go ahead and open up this file.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And what we're going to do with this manifest file is we need to add everything for our extension.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, I'm going to go through this step-by-step. The first thing that we're going want is our manifest

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
version, so I'm just going to do this in a JSON format.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, I'm going to say manifest_version:2 and then comma, and then we're going to add each property just like this.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, this manifest version 2 is going to specify that this is version 2 of the manifest.json format.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And that's the version, the current version that we want to use.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then we're going to specify the name of our extension which we're just going to call this Hello World.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And then we're going to specify what the description is, so we'll use this description property.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And we're going to say this is my fist Chrome extension. And we're going to skip the icon for the actual

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
extension itself at this point since we're not really going be installing this anywhere.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But, we will put an icon for our actual browser action which we'll discuss here in a minute.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, after we have our description we want to put in our inversion.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This one is required and we're just going to make this be version 1.0.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then in the next section we're going to make this a browser action.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Remember that a browser action is going to mean that this extension is going to be a button that's going to

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
be available at the Chrome toolbar and that's how we're going to activate this.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, in order to do this, we're actually going to make an object inside here that's going to have some properties.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, we're going to say browser_action and then we're going to use these brackets to indicate that this is

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
another JavaScript object in this JSON or JavaScript object notation.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, you can think of this as sort of like sub-properties. So, for browser action we're going to specify

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
what the default icon should be and in our case it's going to be icon.png.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, we're going to need to make an icon, and we'll do that a little bit later.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And our icon will actually need to be 19x19 pixels. And then we want to specify what our HTML page that

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
is going to be shown when someone clicks this browser action.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, we're going to say default_popup and we're going to set this equal to popup.html.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, we'll need to go ahead and create an HTML file called popup.html and put in our directory.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, that's all we're going to do for our manifest file.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just to recap this real quick, we have our manifest version, we've got our information about our actual

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
extension including the name description and the version number of the actual extension,

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and then this browser action. Remember we could actually have a browser action or a page action or

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
neither of those, but in our case we're using browser action which means that it's going to be one

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
of those extensions that's going to appear in the toolbar and when we click it, it's going to display something.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, the icon it's going to show is going to be this icon.png and when we click it

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
it's going to show this popup.html. So, we'll need to create that popup.html.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And this is just a very, very simple manifest file, of course, like we had discussed you can add a lot

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
more options to a manifest file. And you can check out that documentation on the manifest files to find

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
out more about what is available.
