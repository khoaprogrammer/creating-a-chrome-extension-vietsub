00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first thing we'll need to create our Hello World extension will be the manifest file.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The manifest file will describe our extension and reference the HTML file we'll be using to display our

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
UI when someone clicks our extension icon in the toolbar. The manifest file uses the JSON format as you can

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
see in this example. So, it's pretty easy to read. At a minimum, a manifest file must have the manifest

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
version properties specified, which in our case will be 2. The name property which is the name of the extension,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the version property which is the version number for your extension.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A description and any icon files are optional, but you should probably include those properties if you're

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
going to put the extension in the Chrome Web Store. Also, in the manifest file, we can specify whether

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
an extension will be a browser action or a page action or neither.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Remember, a browser action is going to show an icon in the toolbar that can be clicked to activate the extension,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
while a page action will show an icon in the address bar of certain pages.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We can also specify the background page for an extension if it has one, or the context scripts the extension

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
will use if it has those, as well as an options page, permissions, and a pretty large list of other

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
properties for the extension. You can find a complete list of all the properties of a manifest file here.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a good idea to read through this list at some point so that you can understand all the capabilities

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that can be defined in the manifest file.
