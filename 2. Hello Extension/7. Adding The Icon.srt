1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so at this point we can almost preview our extension by loading it into Chrome.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The only thing that we really need in order to do this at this point is our

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
PNG for our icon. So, I'm going to go ahead and go to our directory here.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I've already created an icon.png, I'm just going to Paste this in here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's take a look at that real quick. It's just a picture of a world here for our Hello World

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that I just created. It's just a 19x19 pixel icon.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a PNG file. So, that's specified in our manifest.json file which we're definitely going to need

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
in order to be able to load this and test this out. And so, let's go ahead and go to our browser.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead and go to extensions.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, we're just going to do chrome://extensions and then I'm going to switch Developer mode on.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, by default this will be off. It we click Developer mode you'll see this Load unpacked extension.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We can go here and we can just browse to the directory that contains our extensions.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, this Hello World directory.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, then I'm going to click OK. And now you can see it's loaded this extension and we can see that it

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is set up, it's Enabled. We can remove it here if we want to. And you should see it show up in the bar now.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So now, if I click this, you can see it shows this HTML. That's all we really need to create an extension

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
at this point. Now, we're going to add a little bit more functionality to our extension just to see how things work.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're going to keep things pretty simple, but that's really the basics.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We just have a manifest file that specifies an icon that specifies the HTML and we just have a simple HTML page.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You can make an extension that is really this simple.
