JavaScript files can also be included in an extension. In fact, it'd be hard to give an extension

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
much functionality without including some JavaScript to make it work.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To use JavaScript in an extension, simply create a JavaScript file and include it in extension directory,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then reference it either from an HTML page or the manifest file.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Developers often ask if they can use external JavaScript libraries like jQuery in their extensions,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and if so how to do it. It's actually pretty easy and straight forward.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just include the desired JavaScript file in your extensions directory, just like any other JavaScript file,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and reference it from your HTML.
