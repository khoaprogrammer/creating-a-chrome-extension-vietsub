1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, just as you might except, we can also add CSS. We could put that in line into our HTML or we can

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
just go ahead and create a new style sheet.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm just going to create a style sheet; we're just going to call this popup.css.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And we're just going to put a simple style in here just to show how this works.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, I'll just go ahead and edit this.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And we're just going to put in this popup.css one small style here on the h1, we're just going to make

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it so that the color for our text is basically going to just be blue.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, we'll just put that in and then we're just going to go into our popup.html and we'll just add a reference

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to our style sheet. We'll do this just like you would for any other HTML page.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're just going to do a link rel=stylesheet and then type=text/css. And then the actual href for this.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And we're just going to put popup.css.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, one thing to note here, is that we are doing this relative because everything is in the same directory.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, whenever we're referencing something, we're just basically referencing it without any kind of path here.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's just a relative reference. So, this should reference our CSS.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So now, if we go ahead and save this, we can go ahead and open up a Chrome browser.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And inside here if we click on our pop-up, now you can see its being styled, it's coming up in blue.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And we're going to get into this more when we look at the Chrome developer tools.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But, I do want to show you, real quick, that if you wanted to use the Chrome DevTools on this,

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the easiest thing to do is just to go to Inspect element.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then you can see it'll pop-up a little version of the DevTools that's basically targeting this.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's not the actual page itself. You just bring up the Chrome DevTools on the page; you're not going to

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
see the right thing. But you can use this to do some debugging and like I said in the last module,

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we'll get into this much more.
