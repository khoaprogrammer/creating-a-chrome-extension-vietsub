1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so what we're going to do at this point is we're going to add some JavaScript.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to add some JavaScript to add this functionality that's going to

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
make it so that when a user types their name into that input box, it's going to echo their name back

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and say Hi, and then whatever their name is. So, in order to do this, we're actually going to use

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
jQuery, and then we're also going to use own JavaScript.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, the first thing I'm going to do is show you how to get jQuery added to our extension.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is pretty simple, all we're going to do is basically just go to jQuery.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, we're just going to the jquery.com.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And then we're just going to download jQuery.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And you can get whichever you want, the compressed or uncompressed;

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it doesn't really make much of a difference for an extension, so I'm just going to get the uncompressed version.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I'm just going to go ahead and do a Save as here.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I'm going to save this.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And I'm actually just going to save this right to that folder.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, let's just go right into here in Hello World

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and we're just going to Save this.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, so now we have jQuery. And then the next thing we're going to do is create our own JavaScript file

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that we're going to utilize here. So, let's go ahead and do New, Text Document.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And we're just going to call this popup.js.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And we'll need to go ahead and add this functionality, so I'm going to edit this.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I've got Visual Studio open here and what we're going to want to do is include our jQuery file as

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
well as our popup.js. So, we're just going to do this just like we would do in any normal HTML page.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're going to include our script here, right inside of the head.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, we're just going to say script src=jquery let's go ahead and get the correct name for this.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So that will include jQuery and do remember with the script tags that you do have to use this closing

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
script or you might have some problems. And then we're going to do another one and we're just going to say

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
src=popup.js and that will include our popup.js. So, now let's go ahead and edit our popup.js.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And what we're going to do inside this popup.js is we're basically just going to create some

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
real simple functionality. I'm using jQuery here, you don't have to use jQuery if you don't want to jQuery.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But, I do find it a little bit easier to create JavaScript functionality like this with jQuery.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So, I'm basically setting this up so that this is going to run on document ready, this function that

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we're specifying here, and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our element with the ID name

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
which is going to be our input box, and I'm going to register an event handler for keyup.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So, basically whenever you type into that box when the key is up, after you're done typing, it's going

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to execute this particular function. So, we're just going to create our function here.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And inside this function, what we want to do is we're going to want to echo back that name.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, I'm going to go ahead and get our greeting which will be our h1,

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and I'm going to set the text=Hi comma space and then I'm going to do a plus here, and I'm just going

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
grab that name again. So, we're going to get the text that's in there.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, we're going to say name.val which will get the value of the name and then we're going to add an exclamation.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So, that's it. Some really simple functionality, not a lot to this, but let's go ahead and test this out.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, the nice thing about testing this out is we don't actually have to reload this inside our browser.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It's going to automatically reload for us.
