Extensions can be as simple as a single manifest file and an HTML or JavaScript file.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But, most extensions will make use of several different kinds of files to create the desired functionality.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
To start creating an extension you just need to create a directory in which you'll put all the files that

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
extension will use. In this directory you'll have to at least have a manifest file which is a JSON formatted

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
file that describes the properties of the extension. If your extension is going to have a user interface,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you'll probably need to include one or more HDML files in the directory as well.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Extensions can also have icons which are used in the Chrome store and the manage extensions tab in Chrome

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and to display the extension in the Chrome toolbar. Those icon files should also be included in this

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
extensions directory. JavaScript files, CSS, and Images or any other files needed by the extension can

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
be included in there as well. Everything in the directory can be referenced using relative paths starting

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
from this directory. So, the Chrome extension directory is like a self-contained HTML application.
