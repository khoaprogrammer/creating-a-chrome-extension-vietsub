00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, so let's test this out. I've got a Chrome window open, and we're just going to basically

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
click our extension. And when we do that it pops up, and now if I type in my name, you can see it says Hi, John!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, whatever I type in here, it's going to echo back to me. Pretty simple functionality, but this is really

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
how easy it is to create a Chrome extension. And you could do whatever you wanted in there, you're basically

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
just using some JavaScript and HTML. Now, we're not using really the Chrome APIs at this point.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll show you a little bit about how to do that next and definitely in the next modules we'll be

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
getting into that. But, you don't even really have to. You can basically create an app that's

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:59:00,000
essentially launched from this button inside Chrome if you want to, if that's all that you need to do.
