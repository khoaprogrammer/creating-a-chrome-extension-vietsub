Hi, this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight and in this module we'll be creating a simple Hello World

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
extension for Chrome. Chrome extensions themselves are pretty easy to create.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But, all the extra JavaScript and functionality inside of an extension can make it seem much more complex.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To avoid any of this complexity, we'll be creating a very basic browser action extension that just shows a

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
basic UI where a user can type in their name and see it echoed back to them with a greeting.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This basic extension will help us understand how extensions are put together and get us some experience

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
with going through that process before creating a more complicated extension like we'll do

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in the following modules. By the end of this module you should understand the components you need

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in order to create a Chrome extension and know how to add an extension you're developing

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to an instance of Chrome to test it out.
