Now, we can include one or more HTML files in our extension directory to be used with our extension.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In our case, we'll be including a popup.html file which will be used to display the UI for our extension

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
when the icon is clicked in the toolbar. HTML files used in extensions are just regular HTML documents

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
just like you would define for any web application with one important exception; you can't include embedded

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
script in the HTML file. This means you'll have to reference any JavaScript you want to use for your

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
HTML page as a JavaScript file that contains a script. Other than that, there's no special restrictions

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
imposed on HTML files that you use in your extension.
