Well, congratulations! You've created your first Chrome extension. I bet it was easier than you thought.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The basic process of creating an extension is pretty simple as long as you create a manifest file

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and include the appropriate resources, Chrome does the rest for you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you're already creating web applications using HTML and JavaScript, you'll probably find creating

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
extensions to be extremely easy. But, this simple example doesn't really represent what a real extension

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is likely to look like. We weren't really interacting much with the Chrome APIs, and our extension isn't

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
really implementing much functionality. In the next module, we'll create a more robust extension

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that does a little more than our simple Hello World extension, and makes use of more of the Chrome APIs.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thanks for joining me, and take care.
