1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so now let's go ahead and actually add our content script.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So we're just going to go ahead and go to our directory here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And we're going to create a file, so let's do a ‘New Text Document' and we're going to call this Pluralsight_cs.js.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now we're going to go ahead and

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
open this up, and by the way with our content script, if it's going to run on Pluralsight, we do have to

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
add a permission for this as well in order to be able to give our extension permission to operate on any

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of those sites that we want to use this from. So let's go ahead and do that real quick before we actually

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
implement our content script. So all we're going to do is we're going to give it a general permission for

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Pluralsight, so we're just going to add here http://Pluralsight.com/*, so that'll make sure that it has

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
permission for anything it needs to do on Pluralsight.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now inside here, what we actually want to do is we're going to want to basically send a message to our

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
eventPage that's going to tell it to go ahead and display the page_action.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
All this at this point is just to get the page action being displayed correctly.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now remember, our content script is going to run on these particular pages, so it's going to immediately run

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
this JavaScript, and what we're going to do by doing this is make sure that our page_action only shows up

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
when we're at one of these URLs or a URL that matches one of these.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, we're going to go into our Pluralsight_cs.js and here what we want to do is basically just send a message

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that says to show. Okay, so what we're going to do inside here is we're just going to do chrome.runtime.sendMessage

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and then here we can send a message and it can basically be any object.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So we're just going to create an object that we're going to have a property called action on and we're going

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to set the action equal to show. You could do whatever kind of format you wanted in order to make this work.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm just going to use this so that we'll have some convention of we're going to check what the action is,

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the action is going to say what that particular action should be, so we're basically just sending this show message.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now remember, this script is going to run on any page that matches this matches here.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, as soon as this runs, it's going to be sending this message that's going to say show.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then on our eventPage, we want to go ahead and receive this message and check for that show action.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If it's a show, then we're going to go head and actually show it — we don't want to show this always.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So instead of just executing this code, we're going to change this now and we're going to say,

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
chrome.runtime.onMessage, addListener, so this is going to add a listener for us, and this is going to take

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
a function, this will be our callback, which will give us the request, it'll give us the sender, and we can

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
send a response. Now we won't actually need to send a response in our case, so then we're going to go ahead

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and actually put this all inside here and we want to check to see if the request.action is equal to show

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
before we do anything, and then let's go ahead and end this correctly.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, so now let's talk real quick about what's going to happen here.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, we're going to load up a page; when we load up that page, if it matches here, it's going to run

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
these two scripts — this Pluralsight one and this jQuery one.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This Pluralsight one, if it runs, it will send a message that has an action set to show and then this

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
eventPage has already registered to receive any messages. So any messages that come through it's going to

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
receive, it's going to check to see if it gets show, and if it does then it's going to figure out what

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the currentWindow, current activeTab is, and it's going to show the pageAction for that.
