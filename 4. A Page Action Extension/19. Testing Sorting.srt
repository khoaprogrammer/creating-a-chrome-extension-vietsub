1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, so let's go ahead and reload our extension just to make sure that it is up-to-date.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we'll just reload this, and now if we go to, let's say, the Pluralsight New Releases page, and then we

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
click on our page_action, we can click this â€˜Make sortable' and you can see it's actually modified this

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
table and now all of these columns are sortable, so we could actually sort by author, and now you can see

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that it's sorted alphabetically by author. We can still even add our courseCounts, so now we can see the

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
actual courses that each author has done all on this single page.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We can find out some interesting information, like what is the longest and shortest course.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We can sort by duration here, so we can see that the shortest course is IronRuby by Example, and then if I

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
were to sort the other way, the longest course is this Design Patterns Library and then Advanced BizTalk Server 2010.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can also sort by release date or the level. So, this is a pretty useful functionality that we've

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
been able to add very easily. We can also do this on the popular,

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so on the Top 100 Leaderboard we could sort by author here just by activating this to make sortable,

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and now we have that functionality. So you can imagine, there's quite a few different things that you could use this for.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You could create all kinds of functionality for different web pages and extend them with a chrome extension.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Instead of trying to modify the web page or do something else, you can basically just add on and add your

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
own code and add your own functionality and features. This is a really useful way to be able to utilize

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
something that someone else has created and be able to add functionality to it without having to reimplement it.
