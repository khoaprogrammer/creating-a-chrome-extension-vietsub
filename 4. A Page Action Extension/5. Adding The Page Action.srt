1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So next we're going to go ahead and create our popup.html.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm just going to go ahead and create a file here and we'll just call this popup.html and we're just going

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to create our user interface, we're just going to make a really, really simple user interface, just like we did

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for our browser_action. So let's go ahead and put our doctype html in here and then add our html and then

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we'll add a head tag and we want to have a body tag. And inside our head, we'll just go ahead and put the title,

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which we'll call this Pluralsight Helper, and then for our script we're going to add jQuery just like we did before.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let me go ahead and copy this to get the exact name and we'll need to copy jQuery, of course, into our plug-in directory

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and then we're going to have another script, which will be our script for this page, which we'll just call

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
popup.js, just like we did for the other extensions. And inside the body, we'll just put an h1 that says,

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Pluralsight Helper Options, and then let's add two buttons; we're just going to make one button with the id

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of courseCounts — this we'll use for our course counts, this will be a submit button, and we'll give it a

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
value of "Add course counts" and then let's go ahead and copy this and we'll add a second button,

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which will be called makeSortable, in order to make the table sortable, and we'll call this "Make sortable."

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So that's it, just a very simple user interface; remember, this user interface is going to be displayed when

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we actually click on that page action. Now, when we first set up this extension, we're not going to see the

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
page action; we're going to go ahead and install the extension at this point to make sure that our manifest

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
file is correct and that everything is correct next, but before we could do that we do need to create this

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
popup.js and make sure our jQuery is in the directory. So let's go ahead and do that real quick.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're just going to do a ‘New Text Document' and we'll just make a popup.js and we're not going to put

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:59:00,000
anything in there yet and then we're going to go ahead and copy jQuery into our directory.
