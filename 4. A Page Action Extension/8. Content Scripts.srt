We've already briefly mentioned Content Scripts, but let's dive a little deeper now that we have more of

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
an understanding of how extensions work in Chrome. Up till this point, everything we've done as an extension

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
has worked at a high level. Nothing we created so far actually manipulated an actual web page and its data.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In fact, using browser actions, page actions, and even background pages and event pages, we can't actually

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
do much to a page itself. In order to actually manipulate a loaded page with our extension, we need to use

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
a content script. Content scripts are registered in the manifest file and include a Matches property to

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
determine what pages the content scripts will run on. Most often this is a URL with a wild card.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For example, with our extension, we'll be running our content scripts on certain Pluralsight URLs.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The content script itself can be JavaScript or CSS. You can really think of the content script as being

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
some additional JavaScript or CSS that's run when a certain page loads.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Content scripts basically get tacked onto a loaded page and can operate on those pages like any other script or CSS,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but content scripts can't actually utilize most of the functionality of the chrome APIs available to other

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
parts of an extension; they have to pass messages to get their work done, which we'll talk about next.
