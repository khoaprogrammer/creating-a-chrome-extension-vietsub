1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so the next thing that we'll need to do is to actually

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
make it so that our content_scripts has a listener to be able to receive the message.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we're going to go back into our content script and remember we were just sending this message before,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but now we're actually going to do this chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener, so this will make sure that

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we're listening for messages, and then we're going to have a callback â€” that'll be a function that takes

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
a request and then a sender and then a sendResponse. Then inside here, we're just going to check to see

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
what the message was, so we're going to say if(request.action == "courseCounts", then that's the one that we

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
want to handle, so we will do something with this message. So we're going to actually implement the

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
functionality to add up the courses per author and go ahead and change the DOM or change the HTML that's in

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that page to show the courseCounts next to the author name. Now I'm just going to copy some code that I had

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
written before to do this and we're not going to go over this code, because this isn't really important to

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
creating the extension, but it basically just goes through, finds out all the authors, it creates this map,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and counts up each one of the courses, and then it's going to go ahead and modify the actual DOM to display

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the author name followed by the course count. Okay, so let's go ahead and test this out next.
