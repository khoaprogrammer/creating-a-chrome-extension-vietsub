1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now to go ahead and display our page action, we're going to start off by just creating an event page,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
just like we did with the last extension, and this event page is just going to contain the JavaScript

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to just show the page action. Now it's going to show it on every page by default, because it's just going

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to run for every page, but when we actually create our content script, we're going to make the content script

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
be responsible for telling the event page to go ahead and show it and then it will only show it for the

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Pluralsight website, but we're just going to do this to get started.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, we're going to go ahead and create a new document, we're going to call this eventPage.js, and then

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we're going to go ahead and go into our manifest file

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we want to add this event page. We're going to do this just like we did for the previous extension we created,

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so we're just going to say background, and then inside here we go ahead and put in our scripts.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we're going to add scripts and then we have an array of scripts and we're just going to have the one

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
eventPage.js, and then we want to tell this to be persistent false so that we don't have a background page;

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
instead, we're going to have an eventPage, so persistent false.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, so now let's go ahead and modify our eventPage.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We're going to go ahead and drag it into the Editor and what we want to do in this eventPage is we want to

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
basically just show our pageAction. So the way that we do that is we just do chrome.pageAction.show and

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
then we're going to specify what the tabId is. Now we don't know what the tabId is so we have to figure out

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
what tab to show this on. So, instead of just doing chrome.pageAction.show, let's go ahead and comment this out,

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
what we're going to do is we're going to do chrome.tabs.query and this is going to let us query the tabs

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
based on some conditions, so we're going to say active equals true.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We want basically the active tab and we want it to be in the current window, so we're going to say,

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
currentWindow: true, as well. And then we can pass back a function that's going to be executed with the

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
tabs passed in as a parameter, it'll be a callback here. So here's our function, so then once we have this,

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
now we can go ahead and paste this in here and we're just going to say chrome.pageAction.show and we can get

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
our tabId by doing tabs

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This should really only be 1, because there's only going to be one active tab for the current window.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, then let's go ahead and close this out, put a semicolon here, and now we should be set to go.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, now we're going to need to reload this in our browser to actually see this show up, so we're just going to

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
first add some permissions to our manifest.json in order to make sure that we can actually manipulate the tabs,

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
which is what we're basically doing when we're doing that query on the tabs, and we're going to be showing

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
our page_action. So we're just going to do a permissions and we're just going to add one permission here,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
which is tabs. Now we'll go ahead and save this.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's open up our browser and I'm going to go ahead and enable my Pluralsight Helper extension.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So when I enable this, it should reload, I'll just reload this one time to be sure, and you can see that our

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
page_action is showing up, and it doesn't actually do anything at this point and it's only going to show up on this page.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's basically showing up when that eventPage runs; remember, we only have one eventPage, so it's going to

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
run wherever this first gets loaded. Since it's on this Chrome extensions page it's going to load up here.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If we go somewhere else or open a new window, it doesn't show up, but we are going to make this work for

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
multiple pages, or actually, the correct pages, once we add our content script - we'll need that in order to

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
be able to make this more conditional. If you wanted, however, you could make it so that, for example,

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
your eventPage hooked into some event, like whenever a page loaded, and then maybe it checked on that page

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
for some certain text, and based on some text, it triggered showing this page_action.
