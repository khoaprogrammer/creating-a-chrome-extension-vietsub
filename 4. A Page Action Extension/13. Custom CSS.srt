00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, now before we move on, I did want to show you one more thing that you can do with content_scripts

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that's actually pretty useful. You can add CSS to style something with the content script; in fact,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
you can basically make an extension that just restyles some web page if you want.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In fact, there are extensions that already do that. So all we have to do is we're just going to create

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
a CSS file, so we're just going to create this Pluralsight_cs.css, and let's go ahead and edit this.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And we're just going to make this make the author name bold and a little bit larger so it'll be easier to see.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That should be pretty clear that our style is working if we see that on the author pages or the course list pages.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So we're going to say font-weight is equal to bolder and then we're just going to do font-size: large.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll go ahead and save this, we'll go to our manifest, and what we're going to do inside here is we're going

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to add CSS. So we can just put a comma here and then add CSS to this and then this is just going to take an

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
array of CSS pages - we just have the one, which is Pluralsight_cs.css, and now if we go ahead and save this

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and we go to our Extensions;

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we'll go ahead and reload this Pluralsight Helper, and now if I go to Pluralsight and I go to, let's say,

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the Top 100 Leaderboard, you can see that the author names are now bold, and they're large.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So I'm basically applying the style automatically to this page and anything that matches this,

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so you can see, of course, our UI is showing up here for our pageAction, but this is really, really useful

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to just be able to restyle something. In fact, you can take an existing website, maybe you don't like the

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
way that it looks, and just create an extension that adds your own custom style to it, and it might actually

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:59:00,000
be useful to other people who are using that website as well.
