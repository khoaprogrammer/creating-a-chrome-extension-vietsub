As a Pluralsight author, I've often found the need to be able to get a count of how many courses authors

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
have produced and sort some of the course data from the Pluralsight website.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to see how well my courses are doing in the Top 100 and be able to see things like, what the longest

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
courses in the library are or the shortest ones. I've always thought it would be nice if I could see

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the number of courses that an author has in the Top 100 or overall how many courses they've produced next

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to the author name, and I've also wanted to be able to sort the columns in the table that displays the courses.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to be building a chrome extension that will allow us to do both of those things.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We'll be creating an extension that will add a little icon like the one you can see here in the address

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
bar whenever there is a Pluralsight page that has course content.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We'll then be able to click that icon to see a list of helper commands we can run on the page.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is to get this working.
