Hi, this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight, and in this module I'll be showing you how to create a Page Action Extension.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So far we've created two browser action extensions, and while browser action extensions are useful,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we don't always need our extension to be available on every page we visit in Chrome.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
By creating an extension that uses a page action instead of the browser action, we can create extensions

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that are more tailored to specific content on web pages or specific web pages that will be displayed and add

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
functionality conditionally. This is a very powerful way to build chrome extensions, because it allows us

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to create extensions that aren't always taking up space on the toolbar and are able to show up at the right time

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to do something useful. I'll also be showing you how to use content scripts, which are another powerful

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
tool in the Chrome Extensions toolbox that allows us to actually inject JavaScript in CSS into an active page

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to change it however we like. By the end of this module, you should be able to create your own

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:59:00,000
page action-based extension, understand how to pass messages, and utilize content scripts.
