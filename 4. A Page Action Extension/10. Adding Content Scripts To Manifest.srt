1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so let's go ahead and add a content script to our extension.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So what we're going to do is we're basically just going to add here a section for any content scripts.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're just going to call this content_scripts and then inside here we're going to add an array of the

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
content_scripts that are going to be added. Each one is going to be a particular object, so let's go

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
ahead and add an object here, and then we're going to want to have a matches property, so we're going to

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
specify what this should match, and I'm just going to copy this.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to use a couple of the Pluralsight URLs that have some course lists here.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We don't want this to show up on every single page in Pluralsight and we don't want this to show up on

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
non-Pluralsight pages, so we're going to say basically anything under this training/Courses/* -

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this * is a wild card, which means that it'll match anything that starts with this, and then anything under

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
this URL as well, and you can match your wild cards on a couple of different things.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can check out the wild card matching if you look at the content_scripts in the chrome documentation for extensions.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It has a few other ways that you can use to match them, but most often you'll probably use matching similar

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to how we're doing it here. So, next we're going to specify what our JavaScript is, so we're going to say

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
js and then here we have an array of our JavaScript. So, what we're going to include here is a JavaScript file

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that we're going to call Pluralsight_cs (for content script) .js and then we're actually going to add our

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
jQuery as well, because we want to have that accessible from our content script, so we want to make sure

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that we include this. Whenever you use content_scripts, if you have some library that you're going to use,

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you might want to include it here because you can't always rely on that being on our page.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So instead of us relying on this version of jQuery existing on the page, we're going to make sure that we

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:59:00,000
include it here, and we'll go ahead and add a comma after this, so now our manifest file should be complete.
