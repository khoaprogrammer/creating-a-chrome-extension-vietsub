1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, let's go ahead and get started. We're going to start just like we did with the other extensions by

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
creating our extension directory first. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new directory here

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
called PluralsightHelper. And inside here, we're going to start off by creating our manifest file.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, we're just going to do a â€˜New Text Document' and we'll call this manifest.json.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, and we'll go ahead and open this up; I'm just going to edit this in Visual Studio.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Like I said, you can use whatever editor that you want, and we're just going to create our manifest file

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
just like we've done before. And remember that we want to start with our manifest_version, which is 2,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and then we're going to want to add our name here, so the name for this one, we're going to call this

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Pluralsight Helper, and then we want to have a description and we'll just make this say "Adds functionality

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to the Pluralsight website." And don't forget your commas. And then we're going to say that this is

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
version 1.0 of our extension. Okay, now we're just going to start off by creating a page action,

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so I'm just going to go ahead and add this page action section right now to our manifest, so we're going to say,

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
page_action, and we're going to do this instead of that browser action.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We can't have a page action and a browser action; obviously for an extension it has to be in one place or the other.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So then we're going to put in our default_icon and we'll just call this icon.png; I've already created an

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
icon that we can use here, and then we're going to put a default_title in here; this'll be just a title of this page action,

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which will be Pluralsight Helper. Then we're going to add a default popup, so we're going to say,

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:59:00,000
default_popup, and this works just like it did for the browser action; we're just going to call this popup.html.
