00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Content scripts do not have the ability to directly communicate with Background Pages or UI Pages or most of

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the other chrome APIs. In order for a content script to be able to do something like show a page action,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
for instance, or update a badge count, the content script has to use the chrome message API to send a message

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that another part of the extension is listening for. Most commonly, you'll use this messaging API to send

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
single messages to and from content script using the chrome.runtime.sendMessage and

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
chrome.tabs.sendMessageMethods, but Chrome also supports long-lived connections using ports,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
passing messages to other extensions, sending messages from web pages, and even messaging with native applications.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In this course, we'll just be using the simple and most used approach of sending messages to and from

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
content scripts though. We'll be using messaging to both send a message from the content script to the

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
event page to tell it to display the page action and from the page action UI to the content script to tell

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:59:00,000
it to make modifications to the page.
