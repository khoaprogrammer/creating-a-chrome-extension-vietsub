1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so now we should be able to go over here and reload our extension.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we're just going to go into Extensions and Pluralsight Helper, and now if we go to Pluralsight,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we go to, let's say the

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Top 100 Leaderboard, we can see that our CSS is being applied, we've got our pageAction, but if I click this

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
‘Add course counts', now you can see that instantly I have basically gotten all of the counts for each

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
author so we can see how many courses that they have on the Top 100.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And you can see here that Scott Allen is still dominating the Top 100 with 14 courses up there,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so this is pretty neat; we can actually apply this to the new releases page as well.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And this has actually all the courses that have been released on Pluralsight from day one, so it's pretty

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
interesting if we do this one. We can get the courseCounts for every single author, so you can see

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
how many courses each author has done, what their total number of courses is.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And just to recap real quick what's happening when we're doing this is, when we click this button here this

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
‘Add course counts', it's basically figuring out what the active tab is, it's sending a message to the

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
content script here, so this content script receives the message, and then it executes the JavaScript that's

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
going to manipulate this page. Our actual UI here, the JavaScript behind this, can't manipulate the page

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
directly; it's not even really attached directly to a page, it's attached to our extension to our actual

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
pageAction, so we have to use this indirection, we have to use the message passing in order to be able to

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
get access to the actual page.
