00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We talked briefly about page actions in the first module, but I wanted to go over them one more time here

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
now that we have seen browser actions and can better understand the difference between the two.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
As you can see here, a page action, unlike a browser action, shows up in the address bar and it isn't always there.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In fact, by default, the page action doesn't show up at all; you have to explicitly call into the Chrome API

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to tell Chrome to show a page action. This is the key difference between the two.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Other than that, the only major difference is that a page action can't have a badge like we had added to

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the Protein Tracker to show the total protein count. We can create a UI for the page action, just like

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we could for a browser action, as you can see here. When creating a chrome extension, it's important to

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
realize when it makes sense to use a page action instead of a browser action.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It is best to make an extension that only works in a subset of pages or websites, a page action in most cases,

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
because it doesn't end up taking a valuable screen real-estate in the toolbar when it isn't needed.
