1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so now let's go ahead and load this extension into Chrome.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We do need one last thing before we do this — we need to copy our icon in here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I just went ahead and created this icon, it's just a little Pluralsight icon with a plus here to indicate

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it's Pluralsight Helper, and so now that we have that, we can go ahead and do this ‘Load unpacked extension'

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and then we're going to look for our extension, which is Pluralsight Helper, click OK, and we should see

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Pluralsight Helper is showing up in here. Now, we're not going to see anything at this point,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because remember, unlike a browser action that shows up automatically inside here, a page action is going to

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
show up right here at the end of this address bar, but it's only going to show up when we actually show it.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So we actually have to implement some JavaScript that's going to tell Chrome to show this; otherwise,

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we're not going to actually even see anything from our extension at this point.
