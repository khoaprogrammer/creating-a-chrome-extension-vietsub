00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Alright, at this point we've created several chrome extensions, utilizing most of the common functionality

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of chrome extensions. We've created a Browser Action Extension that's able to store data and add menu items

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we just finished creating a Page Action Extension, complete with content scripts that let us actually

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
change the way a website behaves and add functionality. With these basics, you should be able to figure out

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
how to create an extension to do just about anything you want inside of chrome, within reason of course.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But, what good is creating extensions if you can't debug them and get them deployed for other people to use?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Up next, we'll be covering how to debug the chrome extensions we've created using the Chrome Developer Tools

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and how to package up our extensions and deploy them to the Chrome Web Store.

00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thanks for joining me, and take care.
