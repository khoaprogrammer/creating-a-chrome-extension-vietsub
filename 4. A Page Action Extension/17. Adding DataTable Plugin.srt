1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now the last thing we're going to implement for our plug-in is to make it so

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that this table here is sortable when we click this â€˜Make sortable' button.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now rather than reinventing the wheel, we're actually going to use a jQuery plug-in called DataTables.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we can go to jQuery datatable and here you can see there's this DataTables plug-in for jQuery.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm just going to use this as an example of how you could use a plug-in or use something else in your content scripts.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So what we're going to do is we're just going to download this,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then we're going to go ahead and get the JavaScript file out of here.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So inside here, you'll find underneath the media there's a js and then here there's this jquery.dataTable.js.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we're just going to go ahead and add that to our extension, we'll just drop it in here, and then what

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we're going to do is modify our manifest file to include this. So we can just go to our Editor and then

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in our manifest here we can add for our js for our content_scripts, this data table, so we're just going

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to add this one and let's go ahead and copy this so we get the right name.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, so now what's going to happen is that any of the pages that load our content_scripts are also going

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to load this jQuery.dataTables.js, which is going to give us the ability to very easily convert a regular

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
table into a sortable table.
